Ignoring some files and folders by default
Often, we work with temp or personal files that we don't want to commit in
the repository. So, when you commit all files, it is useful to skip certain kinds of
files or folders.
To achieve this result, we can create a .gitignore file in the repository. Git will
read it and then skip the files and folders we listed inside it.
