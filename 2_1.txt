Commit messages
In the first chapter, we made two commits, and every time, we added a commit
message. Adding a commit message is not only a good practice, it is mandatory. Git
would not accept commits without a relative commit message. This is a thing I really
appreciate. Let me explain it briefly.
In other versioning control systems, such as SVN, commit messages are optional.
Developers, we all know, are lazy people. When they are in a hurry or under stress,
the temptation to commit code without telling what feature of the software they
are going to add, modify, improve or delete is strong. In no time, you build a mute
repository with no change history, and you have to deal with commits that are
difficult to understand. In other words, welcome to hell.
